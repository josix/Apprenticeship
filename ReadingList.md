閱讀清單來自於《學徒模式，優秀軟體開發者的養成之路》(Apprenticeship patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman)中第六章, 安排自我課程:

Reading List comes from the chapter 6, Construct Your Curriculum, of 《Apprenticeship patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman》

> ## Reading List:
> ### Context
> After developing enough competence and skill to become proficient in Your First Language, you’re beginning to look around and see the incredible amount of information you still need to learn.
> ### Problem
> The number of books you need to read is increasing faster than you can read them.
> ### Solution
> - Maintain a Reading List to track the books you plan to read, and remember the books you’ve read.
> - This pattern is not just about managing the books you plan to read. It is also a mechanism for reflecting on your past reading habits.
> - With data spanning several years, you can start to see patterns, trends, and gaps in the things you’re choosing to study.
> - If you make this information publicly available, then there is the possibility that other people will contribute suggestions for future reading. This can help you discover hidden connections and obscure gems.
> - Over time, you will discover that certain books keep popping up in bibliographies, and you should move those books to the top of your reading list.
> - The purpose of this pattern is to give you a way to prioritize and filter the flood of potential knowledge.
> ### Action
> Create a text file. Type in all the books you’re currently reading. This is your Reading List, and the simplest possible implementation of this pattern. Now all you have to do is keep this text file up to date.

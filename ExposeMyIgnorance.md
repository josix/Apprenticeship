## More Detail
無知清單的建立來自於《學徒模式，優秀軟體開發者的養成之路》(Apprenticeship patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman)中第二章倒空杯子:
> ## Expose Your Ignorance:
> ### Context:
> The people who are paying you to be a software developer are depending on you to know what you’re doing.
> ### Problem:
> Your managers and team members need confidence that you can deliver, but you are unfamiliar with some of the required technologies.
> ### Solution:
> - Show the people who are depending on you that the learning process is part of delivering software.
> - Tell people the truth. Let them know that you’re starting to understand what they want and you’re in the process of learning how to give it to them
> -  reassure them with your ability to learn, not by pretending to know something you don’t. In this way, your reputation will be built upon your learning ability rather than what you already know.
> - The most obvious way to expose your ignorance is to ask questions...remember that your road to journeyman will be shortened by taking the most direct route available.
> ### Action:
> Write down a list of five things you really don’t understand about your work. Put that list where others can see it. Then get in the habit of refreshing this list as your work changes.

# Apprenticeship
This repo records some experience in my computer science life, and it also contains the implementation of the apprenticeship patterns, the ideas come from [Apprenticeship patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382).

My English isn't very well, and I want to try my best to practice it. So, please correct me if you notice anything wrong in this repository's description.

If possible, leave your feedback or questions as an issue. I would appreciate it.
